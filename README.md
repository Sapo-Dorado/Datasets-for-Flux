# SapoDatasets

This would allow users to construct datasets from files and use them to train a model in a similar fashion to fastai's databunch construction for use with the Flux library for Julia.
At the moment it only works for images but it may be updated at a later date to support text.

Download this package by running

```(v1.2) pkg> add https://github.com/Sapo-Dorado/SapoDatasets```
