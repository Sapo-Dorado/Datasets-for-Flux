# Datasets for Flux

This would allow users to construct datasets from files in a similar fashion to fastai's databunch construction.
At the moment it only works for images but it may be updated at a later date to support text.

Use this code by calling include("(path of this repository)/SapoDatasets.jl"). This code requires the FileIO, Images, Random packages to be on your system.

Check out the ExampleUse folder for an idea of how to use this code
